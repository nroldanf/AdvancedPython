- **Dynamic Language:** All type verification happen at runtime instead of compile time.
- **Multiparadigm**: Object and structure oriented pagadigms supported.

## Python Philosophy

- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated: One piece of code dealing with Many different responsabilities at once. Don't keep many different things in mind to understand a piece code.
- Readibility counts

__PEP__: **P**ython **E**nhacement **P**roposal
Proposing major new features primary mechanism.

## Where Python is used?

- SysAdmin
- Web Development: API, Fullstack, App (CMS, ERP)
- Application scripting: With Blender (Open SOurce 3D model generation)
- Big Data
- Machine Learning and Data Science
- Desktop Development
- Robotics

## Python

- python.exe: Rudimentary REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
- pip: pip install packages. 3rd party libraries. Package manager.
- ipython: Robust interactive shell.
- pypi: python package index. People publish the code so it can be used by others.


## Ways to execute Python code

- Interpreter: python.exe
- REPL: Call out python code within interactive REPL (like ipython)
- Natively: py2exe, pyinstaller
