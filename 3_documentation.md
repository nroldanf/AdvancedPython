# Documentation in Python

Based on PEP-257.

- Semantics and conventions for docstrings.
- Docstrings: First statement of a module, function, class or method. The interpreter will read and set the __doc__ variable.
- Docstrings are always inside triple double-quotes """. At least a phrase ending in a period. For methods specify return value.

## Sphinx

It's the Python defacto standard documentation generator.

- __Input format:__ reStructuredText, plain text that uses markup language.
- __Output format:__ HTML, PDF, ebooks, etc.
- Extract the docstring from the code to generate the documentation.
- pip install sphinx
- sphinx-quickstart
- make hmtl: Inside the folder docs where the last command was executed.

To init an sphinx documentation:

```shell
pip install sphinx
```

Create a docs folder, and inside do the following:

```shell
sphinx-quickstart
```

To generate an HTML doc:

```shell
make html
```

To install make and other developer tools you can use:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

## Apidoc

Sphinx extension to extract the docstrings from Python code and generate documentation for that.

- The docstrings are not just plain text but contains reStructuredText. Some of the sphinx directives that can be include into docstrings are:
    - :param
    - :return
    - :ivar
    - :class
    - :meth
    - :func
    - :module
- __NOTE__: Some IDE help with the docstring suggestion and autocompletion, like PyCharm.

To generate the docs from docstrings:

```shell
shinx-apidoc -o docs project_path
```

This will generate the .rst files required by sphinx to generate HTML, pdf, etc. You can replace the index context in index.rst with the modules.rst.

```shell
include:: modules.rst
```

After this you should un-comment the __Path setup__ and specify the project directory and also set the __General configuration__ extensions list.

```python
extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",# enable automodule
    "sphinx.ext.viewcode"# enable to view the code in the generated docs
]
```

Finally, to regenerate all the HTML docs throwing aways all previous html.

```shell
make clean html
```

## Host the documentation generated

readthedocs: Used to host the HTML and connect direct to the Github repository.
Github Pages: Can host the HTML generated by sphinx directly from the repository.
